Sternberg (1968) - serial/parallel search of short-term memory
------------------------------------------------------------------

The experiment: 
    
    In this task subjects must report whether or not a given target was present
    in a previous set of items. The set of values varies in length and the target
    can occur at any position in the set (or not at all). If participants
    search their memory of the set in a 'serial' fashion then their average 
    response time will increase with increasing set size. If memory can be 
    searched in a 'parallel' fashion then RT will be independent of set size.

Analysing your data:

    In the Excel file, in the data/ folder after running the experiment, sort
    the data by set size. Take the RT (the column resp.rt_mean) for all
    the rows with a given set size and calculate the mean. Compare these means
    for different set sizes.
    You could also break the data down by trials where the target was actually
    present or actually absent to investigate whether the search was 'self-
    terminating'.

Notes: 
    
    This study provides a slightly more rich temporal setup; multiple objects 
    must be manipulated and presented at different times on each trial and with 
    a precise time.
