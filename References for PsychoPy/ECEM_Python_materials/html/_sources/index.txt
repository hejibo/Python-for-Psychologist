Py4ET: Python for Eyetracking 2013
****************************************** 

Welcome to the Python for Eyetracking Workshop. We haven't given a workshop quite like this before and some of the technologies we'll be showing you are very much at the cutting edge of what has been developed. So bear with us!

Presenters

 * **Jon Peirce** created PsychoPy. He's never used an eye-tracker!
