Online Python Resources and Q&A
======================================================

Going forwards
----------------------

PsychoPy and ioHub are still improving a great deal all the time. You'll soon see;

    * tighter integration of the two (e.g. less overlap in functionality)
    * less need for code to perform the eye-tracking (e.g. a Builder Component for it)
    * functions being built in for data processing to allow for greater offline (and potentially online) processing of the eye tracking data.
    * within PsychoPy, the major areas of development are better 'sanity checking' of the experiment
    * get on the user list and see how things develop; and email if you find things that need fixing

Online resources
---------------------

Below  are some links to web resources that are valuable sources of information
on Python, useful Python Tools, Python in Neuroscience or Psychology, and 
Eye Tracking with Python. It is not complete so love google!

Python
~~~~~~~

NB **stick to Python 2.7.x for now.** Python 3 is a substantial rewrite and many packages don't yet support it.

    * `Python 2.7.5 Documentation <http://docs.python.org/2/index.html>`_
    * `Python's built-in modules <http://docs.python.org/2/library/>`_

Learning Python
    * `The official Python tutorial <http://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/index.html>`_
    * http://www.Codecademy.com/
    * `Dive into Python <http://www.diveintopython.net/>`_

Python Tools
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

    * `Numpy <http://www.numpy.org>`_ is for fast numeric computations on arrays
    * `SciPy <http://www.scipy.org>`_ extends Numpy with mathematical routines (like optimization, filtering etc.)
    * `Matplotlib <http://www.matplotlib.org>`_ is the main plotting library for Python, using similar syntax to Matlab
    * `IPython <http://www.ipython.org>`_ provides a nice interactive shell for using Python and also a 'notebook' interface for storing notes and documentation along with your analysis code.

Python and Psychology or Neuroscience
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

`PsychoPy <www.psychopy.org>`_ :

    * `PsychoPy Docs <http://www.psychopy.org/documentation.html>`_
    * `ioHub Docs <http://www.isolver-solutions.com/iohubdocs/index.html>`_
    * `PsychoPy downloads (includes ioHub) <http://sourceforge.net/projects/psychpy/files/PsychoPy/>`_
    * `PsychoPy User Group <https://groups.google.com/forum/#!forum/psychopy-users>`_

Also:

    * `NiPy <http://nipy.org/>`_ for neuroimaging
    * The Frontiers journal special issue on `Python in Neuroscience tools <http://www.frontiersin.org/Neuroinformatics/researchtopics/python_in_neuroscience/8>`_ (many about modelling packages)
    
There's also `Open Sesame` (graphical interface for experiments with some eye-tracking support) and `PyEPL` (scripted, no eye-tracking) but neither is as flexible as PsychoPy!

Python and Eye Tracking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 

Some eyetracker manufacturers provide general Python interfaces. Many an difficult to use and incomplete ctypes wrappers of their C library. 

If your eye tracker isn't supported by ioHub (yet) and you would like to help make adding support for it happen, contact us! Why learn a different API for each eye tracker manufacturer you have systems from, when you could only need to be using one, psychopy.iohub!
