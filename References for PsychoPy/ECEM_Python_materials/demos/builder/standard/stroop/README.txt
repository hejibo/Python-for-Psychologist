Stroop - measuring reaction times to incongruent stimuli

This is a lot like the original Stroop task provided in the PsychoPy demos. We just added a Code Component to check that fixation was maintained throughout the trial. To enable this you need to add the name of an eye-tracker config file during the experiment settings dialog.
