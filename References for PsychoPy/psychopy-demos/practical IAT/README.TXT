Task modeled after that reported by JS Mueller, et al.,â€Ž2011, Psych Science.

To obtain a bias score, use the script provided in the "Practical IAT" directory:
% python scoreIAT.py data/data_file_name.csv
data_file_name.csv 0.081

A positive D value (e.g., 0.081) indicates a bias in favor of "practical good / creative bad".

Uses scoring procedure outlined in Nosek et al. (2007), developed by Greenwald Nosek & Banaji (2003), except that RT on incorrect responses do not contribute to average RT (and there's no RT penalty for incorrect responses).

Checks for following exclusionary criteria:
 - 25% of responses too fast in any one of the critical blocks
 - going too fast (<300 ms) on more than 10% of responses across all critical blocks
 - 35% too fast in any one of the practice blocks
 - making more than 30% erroneous responses across the critical blocks
 - 40% errors in any one of the critical blocks
 - 40% errors across all of the practice blocks
 - 50% errors in any one of the practice blocks
