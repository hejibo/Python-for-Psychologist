Balloon Analogue Risk Task (BART) 
------------------------------------------------------------------

The experiment: 
    
    This is a simplified (and prettified) version of the BART task by 
    Lejuez et al (2002). Participants have to blow up a balloon that they know
    will burst at some point. They 'earn' rewards for getting the balloons to be
    larger, but increase the risk of bursting it, in which case they earn no 
    reward for that balloon. The question is, how many times does someone pump
    each balloon trying to optimise their rewards. 
    
    The measure is designed to quantify individual differences in risk-taking.

Analysing your data:

    You should filter out data where the balloon burst and measure the number of 
    pumps made for the remaining trials.

Notes: 
    
    THIS IS AN ADVANCED DEMO INVOLVING LOTS OF CODE COMPONENTS
    
    NB this could be extended to be more similar to the original paper by adding
    further colours of balloons with different bursting profiles.
