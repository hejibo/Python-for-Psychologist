Branching in a PsychoPy Builder experiment
------------------------------------------------------------------

The experiment: 
    
    This isn't really an experiment

Analysing your data:

    n/a
    
Notes: 
    
    There are two ways to stop a set of trials from running. The method
    used here is to set the `finished` attribute of a particular loop to
    be True. This allows you to abort a set of trials even during a run
    (e.g. based on the outcome of the previous trials).
    
    The second, simpler, method is to set the nReps of a loop to be zero.
    This is handy while testing your experiment to run only a subset of the
    trials (e.g. to skip the practice trials).
