                                Mental Rotation

Letter version of a classic cognitive task. Works well in individual subjects, and
group settings; classroom-tested 2013.

The time taken to decide if two images are the same or different depends ~linearly on
the angle of rotation. So the longest time should be at 180 degrees, and the expected
result is a peak-shape graph of RT as a function of rotation angle.

Illustrates saving data into a temporary file, parsing it at the end of the run (using
pandas), display results in a plot (using matplotlib).
